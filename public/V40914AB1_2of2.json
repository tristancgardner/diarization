10.49] Interviewer: All right.\n[10.55 - 12.87] Interviewer: This is an MTF with Liz, Jonah, Alex, and Emma.\n[12.89 - 13.35] Interviewer: Take one.\n[13.39 - 13.99] Interviewer: Time code is 11-40-4-0-3-4-5.\n[14.05 - 14.19] Interviewer: Marker.\n[14.35 - 15.38] Interviewer: Okay, great.\n[15.60 - 16.86] Interviewer: Thank you.\n[17.08 - 18.44] Interviewer: And whatever you are...\n[32.81 - 37.05] Interviewer: Liz, can you tell me what today is and kind of what you're helping your dad with?\n[37.07 - 39.99] Liz: So today is Poppy's birthday, his first heavenly birthday.\n[40.80 - 55.96] Liz: And what we are doing to honor his birthday, dad has been working on a weatherstone, pretty much just a big old stone, engraving the name Poppy into it to place in front of our poppy tree that we planted a couple weeks ago.\n[57.00 - 62.54] Interviewer: And this engraving that you're jumping and helping with, have you ever done anything like this before, or are you learning on the fly?\n[62.78 - 68.22] Liz: I've done similar stuff to this, but more like on wood, a much more softer object.\n[68.39 - 70.57] Liz: But this is my first time engraving in stone.\n[71.75 - 77.31] Interviewer: So, Jonah, you guys come out, and your dad's trying to decide what color he's pulling you guys, what color to fill in.\n[77.75 - 81.89] Interviewer: And you all said, you know, we think it's better plain, but I think you were maybe the most vocal about it.\n[82.31 - 83.75] Interviewer: What made you feel like it was better that way?\n[84.48 - 99.95] Jonah: I think just looking at the rock itself and where it was going to be in the location that it was going to be outside, the weather being very versatile, very hot summers, very cold winters here in Georgia.\n[100.41 - 106.69] Jonah: So over time, I could envision the paint or the color that they're wanting to put on this rock changing.\n[106.95 - 135.25] Jonah: wear off and it will not look so great so therefore i think uh i suggested that we just have it engraved and then leave it as that because over time the rock will uh you know it'll have some characteristics as far as later on down the road years from now because over time all things weather when they're outside so it'll look i think it'll look good a little more natural than if it was artificially you know colored with paint stuff\n[136.64 - 144.30] Interviewer: And Alex, I mean, I don't think Poppy was a particularly glitzy guy, so do you think maybe keeping it simple is more, keeping it more like Poppy?\n[144.86 - 152.87] Alex: I don't think Poppy was, like, super glitzy when it comes to this kind of stuff, so leaving it simple just kind of represents Poppy better, in my opinion.\n[154.35 - 159.66] Interviewer: Emma, when your dad puts it on the trolley and he's going down the stairs, how are you feeling?\n[160.75 - 171.63] Emma: When Dad was putting the rock on the trolley and going down the steps, I was kind of scared because I thought the rock would, like, fall and then into the pool, and then there it goes.\n[172.96 - 174.81] Interviewer: You know your dad's not going to the pool after the rock.\n[174.97 - 177.22] Interviewer: You're the one who's going to sit down for it.\n[177.24 - 179.42] Emma: Dad's definitely not going in the pool to get the rock.\n[179.74 - 181.26] Emma: It's either probably me or one of us.\n[181.82 - 185.02] Liz: None of us because we know it's like to lift heavy objects in the water.\n[185.38 - 187.16] Liz: Unless you've got a crane or a crank.\n[187.32 - 187.54] Liz: Uh-oh.\n[189.33 - 190.85] Interviewer: And then you helped push it down the hill.\n[191.03 - 191.85] Interviewer: Was that scary?\n[191.89 - 193.46] Interviewer: Was it tricky?\n[193.59 - 201.24] Emma: And then I pushed it down the hill, and it was kind of scary because I didn't want to go full force, and then I might fall into the rocks.\n[202.12 - 204.00] Liz: I think the trolley was actually pulling him up.\n[204.36 - 204.60] Emma: Yeah.\n[204.82 - 205.52] Emma: It was pulling me.\n[206.44 - 207.16] Emma: It's not a trolley.\n[207.20 - 208.25] Liz: It's a hand truck.\n[208.26 - 208.65] Liz: Sorry.\n[208.72 - 210.05] Liz: The hand truck was pulling him up.\n[210.91 - 214.15] Liz: Because at one point, you could tell that it was kind of starting to pick up speed.\n[214.41 - 214.67] Liz: Yeah.\n[214.71 - 214.91] Liz: Yeah.\n[216.29 - 219.37] Interviewer: But you were able to stop yourself, and that's what counts.\n[220.77 - 224.88] Interviewer: So, I mean, days like today, obviously you're going to remember your grandfather more.\n[225.34 - 231.72] Interviewer: Are there things in your everyday life, like if you eat a certain snack or hear a certain song, that bring him to memory for you?\n[232.60 - 232.78] Jonah: Oh, yeah.\n[232.82 - 241.97] Jonah: I think, you know, Poppy's always going to be in our memories, but there are going to be certain moments throughout the rest of our lives that certain things may trigger memories of Poppy.\n[242.05 - 251.96] Jonah: Maybe things that we eat, maybe things that we listen to, music, conversations, you know, all that.\n[252.02 - 253.28] Jonah: That's what memories are for.\n[253.32 - 254.66] Jonah: The memories that he gave us are\n[255.08 - 274.39] Jonah: we're able to kind of use and it obviously helps my dad cope with the loss and it helps us all cope with the loss but it's going to be cool because I'm looking forward to the glimpses that we'll see later on down our lives when we all get older and we remember things of Poppy and yeah the tree being one of them.\n[276.15 - 283.75] Interviewer: Your parents are talking about kind of Poppy's legacy of family and how important it is in helping your family and like when you were talking about with your parents like\n[284.40 - 286.48] Interviewer: And how would your family's health look like late and all that?\n[286.50 - 290.00] Interviewer: Can you just speak a little bit about seeing Poppy in that?\n[290.05 - 298.39] Liz: So one of Poppy's biggest, I guess, thing that everybody knows about Poppy is that he is a very selfless person.\n[298.41 - 300.09] Liz: He was.\n[300.29 - 302.32] Liz: He was a very selfless person.\n[302.34 - 303.60] Liz: I still think he's here.\n[304.40 - 306.02] Liz: He was a very selfless person.\n[306.84 - 309.78] Liz: He lent a hand to anybody, anyone.\n[311.25 - 313.09] Liz: He was just that kind of person.\n[313.11 - 325.18] Liz: And it's kind of, you know, see that trait in my parents, because my parents have helped Bryce and I with Leighton, bringing us back into their home, helping them with Leighton, and helping with Jonah whenever Jonah came back home.\n[325.30 - 325.48] Liz: So...\n[326.16 - 329.34] Liz: I mean, it definitely runs in the Johnson side for sure.\n[330.32 - 345.83] Liz: So when speaking about that, mom and dad brought up the possibility of Brandon moving into our home and how that if Poppy was still here, most likely Poppy probably would have either brought him into their home or suggested it to mom and dad to help him.\n[346.39 - 351.35] Liz: And that is what we are doing, what we've been doing for the last almost two months for Brandon.\n[351.37 - 354.57] Liz: My parents have been giving it their all with helping Brandon.\n[355.88 - 360.60] Interviewer: I've heard a lot about how you guys have been there almost as often as your parents have been helping.\n[361.48 - 366.00] Alex: Emma and I have been tagging along with mom and dad pretty often to go help with Brandon.\n[366.42 - 370.08] Alex: We've been up there pretty often too, pitching a hand.\n[371.14 - 372.55] Interviewer: Is that what Poppy would have wanted you to do?\n[372.56 - 375.79] Alex: Yeah, that is definitely something Poppy would have wanted us to do.\n[378.37 - 383.41] Interviewer: Your parents mentioned that Brandon is going to be probably moving in with you guys in the near future.\n[383.80 - 386.27] Interviewer: Jonah, I think that was at least news to you, it seemed like.\n[386.83 - 387.75] Interviewer: Can you talk a little bit about that?\n[388.23 - 393.89] Jonah: Yeah, I mean, I've been incoherent with all of the steps that Brandon has improved on.\n[394.03 - 399.36] Jonah: From the accident to now, he has overcome quite a bit.\n[400.00 - 407.38] Jonah: And the fact that he's in a rehab facility is great because that shows that he's improving.\n[407.96 - 414.79] Jonah: And the more he improves, you're going to have to find other alternatives because due to his circumstances...\n[416.61 - 430.32] Jonah: He doesn't really have a place to live, so when he accomplishes rehab, I think it's a good reward for him, but it's also going to be rewarding for my parents more so because they've been on this journey every step of the way.\n[430.74 - 434.06] Jonah: When the time comes and they bring him to the house,\n[434.88 - 450.02] Jonah: It's not a finish line milestone, but it's definitely a chapter close because he is starting something new and he is healthy enough to be able to do something like this, and that is to move in with us.\n[450.04 - 451.18] Jonah: So I think it'll be good for all of us.\n[454.57 - 459.97] Interviewer: And then last thing, I know your dad was saying he was kind of hoping it would rain today since it rained when you planted the tree.\n[460.61 - 464.93] Interviewer: Are you guys happy that maybe it wasn't a downpour and as much hard labor as the tree?\n[465.43 - 474.36] Liz: We are very happy that it was just a little drizzle today instead of the downpour that we were facing when planting this tree because that was not fun.\n[474.48 - 479.12] Liz: So we'll take the next little mist and keep it that way.\n[479.18 - 479.84] Interviewer: Let's do 30 seconds.",
